## Project Background
Escape the Maze was my final assignment in the Computer Graphics course. 
Escape the Maze is a 3d game made using WebGL1.0 primitive shapes and textures.
There are three levels and a title menu with several options.

## How to Play the Game
To download the project files, click the Code button, click Download ZIP, and extract the folder.
